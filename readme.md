 # Free QRCode

 This is a hobby project that I created to prevent any mistakes in generating QR Codes, which hidden fees that lures people.

 I fully understand the value of being a middle man and supports making it short and tracking, but charging money for that for non-profit usages are ridiculous

 Just open up the web browser, and feel free to use it.

## The prompt that I used.

```
I'd like to create a simple web application to generate QR Code image for a given URL.
- Mobile friendly page that describes what it does for the user. With a text box for QR Code, and "Generate" button.
- Push Generate, with some error handlings like empty string. Generate the image, including clear what it already showed. If the Generate button is not activated if the text is empty, would be better.
- After generating the image, it should allow download the image with a pressing button.
- It should also suggest what's good side and downside in using public QR Code services, including the trackability of their services.
- Use opensource Javascript library for the QR code.
